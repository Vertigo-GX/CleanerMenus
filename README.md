# [Cleaner Menus](https://modrinth.com/mod/cleaner-menus)
A small client-side Minecraft mod for Fabric that makes certain GUI elements easier on the eyes.

### Features:
* Adds the vanilla blur effect to the background of in-game menus, such as when opening chests. The intensity of the blur can be set via the vanilla accessibility settings.
* Disables the darkening of the background of in-game menus.
* Disables the darkening of the background of game menus, such as the pause menu.
* Disables the front view of the third-person camera.
* All features are optional.

### Configuration:
Either edit the config file (`cleaner-menus.ini`) found in the Fabric config folder (requires a restart for the changes to take effect), or (optionally) use [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) to edit the options in game.
